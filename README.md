# smoke_and_mirrors

An attempt to learn ray tracing techniques and showcase them in a scene containing mirrors and wavelength dependent diffraction of light.
Possible additions - smoke/fog.

Checkpoints:

- [x] Basic ray caster (Lambertian diffuse shading and Blinn-Phong specular shading), shadows included
- [x] Recursive specular shading
- [] Difraction
- [] Path tracer
- [] Ray tracing optimisations (BVH's)
- [] Bidirectional path tracing
- [] Volumetric effects
- [] Tracing light by wavelength
- [] ???
